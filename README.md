In the first phase of the task we designed the architecture of a **RISC type Multi-cycle processor** which is an 8-register, 16-bit computer system and is
based on the Little Computer Architecture which is general enough to solve complex problems.\
\
In its second phase we designed the architecture of a **6-stage pipelined microprocessor** IITB-RISC-22(16-bit computer)
that allowed predicated instruction execution and multiple load and store execution by utilizing 
hazard mitigation techniques like forwarding and branch prediction.
